# MoViScio

MoViScio is a VR system that allows exercise tutoring from a health professional by creating frame-by-frame prescriptive of very accurate goal-postures. The purpose of this system is for the users to conduct strength-rehabilitation and movement re-education exercises. Such a system would be used by health professionals to aid in helping those with autism, type 2 diabetes, anorexia, as well as helping athletes with their sports development and injury recovery.

## Getting Started

A current demo of the VR system in Unity is accessible in the Assets folder.
